Emotion Detection Using CNN
This repository contains the implementation of an Emotion Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to classify human facial expressions into different emotional categories (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.) using image data. This approach utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to accurately detect emotions from facial expressions.

Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
Preprocessing of image data to ensure quality inputs.
Training on a labeled dataset of facial expressions for emotion detection.
Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Visualization of results (e.g., confusion matrix).

Requirements

TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV for image handling
NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations

Run the Jupyter notebook Emotion Detection Using CNN.ipynb to train and evaluate the model.
Dataset
This project can be trained on popular emotion recognition datasets like:

Results
Achieves up to X% accuracy on the test dataset.
Visualizations include accuracy/loss plots, confusion matrix, and sample predictions.

Future Improvements
Experimenting with deeper CNN architectures.
Using transfer learning for improved performance.
Integrating real-time emotion detection via a webcam.
