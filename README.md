Emotion Detection Using CNN
This repository contains the implementation of an Emotion Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to classify human facial expressions into different emotional categories (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.) using image data. This approach utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to accurately detect emotions from facial expressions.

Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
Preprocessing of image data to ensure quality inputs.
Training on a labeled dataset of facial expressions for emotion detection.
Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Visualization of results (e.g., confusion matrix, loss/accuracy curves).
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV for image handling
NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations
Jupyter Notebook for running and modifying the code
How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection-cnn.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset (e.g., FER2013, CK+, or a custom dataset) and place it in the data/ directory.
Run the Jupyter notebook Emotion Detection Using CNN.ipynb to train and evaluate the model.
Dataset
This project can be trained on popular emotion recognition datasets like:

FER-2013: A widely used dataset for emotion detection.
CK+: Another prominent dataset for facial expression recognition.
Make sure to download and prepare the dataset before training.

Results
Achieves up to X% accuracy on the test dataset.
Visualizations include accuracy/loss plots, confusion matrix, and sample predictions.
Future Improvements
Experimenting with deeper CNN architectures.
Using transfer learning for improved performance.
Integrating real-time emotion detection via a webcam.
